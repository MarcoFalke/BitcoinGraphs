To keep your system from clutter, setting up a python virtual environment is recommended:

```sh
virtualenv --python=python3 ./env_3
```

Make sure to install the dependencies
```sh
source ./env_3/bin/activate
pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn
```

To run
```sh
source ./env_3/bin/activate
python3 ./plot_bench.py -h
```
